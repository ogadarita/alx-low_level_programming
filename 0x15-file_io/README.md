# File I/O in C

This repository contains C programs and functions related to file input/output (I/O). File I/O operations are fundamental in programming as they allow reading from and writing to files on the system.

## Tasks Overview

### 0-read_textfile.c
This task involves implementing a function that reads a text file and prints its contents to the POSIX standard output. The function takes the name of the file and the number of letters it should read and print.

### 1-create_file.c
In this task, you'll find a function that creates a file. The function takes the name of the file to create and the text content to write to the file.

### 2-append_text_to_file.c
This task involves implementing a function that appends text to the end of a file. The function takes the name of the file and the text to append.

### 3-cp.c
This program is designed to copy the content of one file to another file. It takes two arguments: the source file to copy from and the destination file to copy to.

### 100-elf_header.c
This program is more advanced and displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file. ELF files are a common file format used for executables, object code, and shared libraries on Unix-like systems
