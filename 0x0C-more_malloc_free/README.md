##More on Dynamic Memory Allocation
Tasks in this project include:
* Writing a function that allocates memory using `malloc`
* Writing a function that concatenates two strings
* Writing a function that allocates memory for an array using `malloc`
** The first application for the calloc function is applied in this task. 
* `calloc` is a function similar to `malloc`, but it initializes the allocated memory to zero
* Writing a function that creates an array of integers

### Advanced Tasks
These are optional tasks in this project. They include:
* Writing a function that reallocates a memory block using `malloc` and `free`
* Writing a program that multiplies two positive numbers
