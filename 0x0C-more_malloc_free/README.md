## More on Dynamic Memory Allocation
Tasks in this project include:
* Task 0: 0-malloc_checked.c - Writing a function that allocates memory using `malloc`
* Task 1: 1-string_nconcat - Writing a function that concatenates two strings
* Writing a function that allocates memory for an array using `malloc`- The first application for the calloc function is applied in this task. 
* Task 2: 2-calloc.c - `calloc` is a function similar to `malloc`, but it initializes the allocated memory to zero
* Task 3: 3-array_range.c - Writing a function that creates an array of integers

### Advanced Tasks
These are optional tasks in this project. They include:
* Task 4: 100-realloc.c - Writing a function that reallocates a memory block using `malloc` and `free`
* Task 5: 101-mul.c - Writing a program that multiplies two positive numbers
