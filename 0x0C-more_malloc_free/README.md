## More on Dynamic Memory Allocation
This project has tasks that apply Dynamic memory allocation in C which allows you to allocate and deallocate memory during program execution. 
It's useful when the size of data structures is not known at compile time.
The standard library provides several functions for dynamic memory management including:
* `malloc`
* `calloc`
* `free`
* `exit`

## Project Tasks 
The Tasks in this project include:

1. 0-malloc_checked.c: Writing a function that allocates memory using `malloc`
2. 1-string_nconcat.c: Writing a function that concatenates two strings
3. 2-calloc.c: writing a function that allocates memory for an array using `malloc`- This task applies the `calloc` function. 
* `calloc` is a function similar to `malloc`, but it initializes the allocated memory to zero
4. 3-array_range.c - Writing a function that creates an array of integers

### Advanced Tasks
These are optional tasks in this project. They include:
5. 100-realloc.c - Writing a function that reallocates a memory block using `malloc` and `free`
6. 101-mul.c - Writing a program that multiplies two positive numbers
